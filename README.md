# **Intent Agent System**

This repository outlines the architecture and implementation of a query-handling system designed to process user queries, detect intents, and interact with both internal and external systems.

## **System Architecture Overview**

![System Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14f1dde2-4d08-4db8-9f5b-dd2689abab78)

This diagram illustrates the architecture of a query-handling system:

1. **User**: The starting point where a user initiates a query.
2. **Intent Agent**: A component that processes user queries to determine the user's intent. It routes requests accordingly.
3. **Router**: Handles the routing of queries or requests to the appropriate service or database manager.
4. **Intent Library**: This orchestrates the whole process of intent addition removal based on the need. 
5. **MongoDB Manager**: Manages interactions with a MongoDB database to store or retrieve relevant data.
6. **MongoDB**: The underlying database used to persist system data.

### **Flow of Operation**
1. The **User** sends a query.
2. The **Intent Agent** analyzes the query to determine its intent.
3. Based on the Intent Library:
   - Data may be fetched or updated in the **MongoDB** via the **MongoDB Manager** .
3. Based on the intent query is routed via the **Router**.

## **Key Components**
- **Intent Agent**: Acts as the brain of the system.
- **Router**: Ensures proper routing of requests to internal or external services.
- **MongoDB**: Stores system data in a flexible and scalable NoSQL format.

## **TODO Tasks**

### **1. Build the Intent Agent**
- Implement intent detection logic.
- Train the system with sample queries to identify user intent accurately.

### **2. Design Router Logic**
- Define routing rules based on detected intents.
- Implement fallback mechanisms for invalid or ambiguous intents.

### **3. Develop MongoDB Manager**
- Create CRUD operations for interacting with MongoDB.
- Implement error-handling mechanisms for database operations.

### **4. Integrate Intent Library**
- create domain, intent, queries
- edit, remove and retrieve domain, intent, queries.

### **5. Testing and Debugging**
- Perform end-to-end testing to ensure all components work together.
- Implement logging for monitoring system performance.

### **6. Documentation**
- Provide detailed setup and usage instructions for developers.
- Document APIs and database schema.
